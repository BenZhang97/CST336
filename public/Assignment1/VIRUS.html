<h2>Introduction:</h2><hr>

<p>A computer virus is a program, script, or macro designed to cause damage, steal personal information, modify data, send e-mail, display messages, or some combination of these actions.

When the virus is executed, it spreads by copying itself into or over data files, programs, or boot sector of a computer's hard drive, or potentially anything else writable. To help spread an infection, the virus writers use detailed knowledge of security vulnerabilities, zero days, or social engineering to gain access to a host's computer.

Note: In most cases, a computer virus cannot infect a CD or DVD disc, as most CDs or DVDs are locked after being created, preventing additional files from being put on that disc.
